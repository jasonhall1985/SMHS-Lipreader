# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

The project has been initialized as a git repository, and all files have been committed locally. However, we were unable to push to GitHub automatically. Follow these steps to manually push the code:

## Option 1: Push to an existing GitHub repository

If you already have a GitHub repository set up:

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/jasonhall1985/your-repo-name.git`)
3. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace the URL with your actual repository URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jasonhall1985/your-repo-name.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Create a new GitHub repository

If you need to create a new repository:

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository (e.g., "smhs-lipreader")
3. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Follow the instructions for "...or push an existing repository from the command line":

```bash
# Replace the URL with the one provided by GitHub
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jasonhall1985/your-repo-name.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Authentication

If you're asked for credentials:
- For username: Enter your GitHub username
- For password: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'repo' scope
  - Generate one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a graphical interface:
1. Install GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Add the local repository (File > Add Local Repository)
4. Publish the repository to GitHub

Your repository is ready to be pushed with all the LipNet backend code intact!
