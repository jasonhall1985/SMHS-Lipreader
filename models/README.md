# Model Files Directory

This directory contains trained LipNet models.

Note: The actual model file `lipnet_model.h5` is not included in the GitHub repository due to its large size (>100MB).

## Getting the Model

You can either:

1. Train the model yourself using the `train.py` script:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

2. Request the pre-trained model from the project maintainer
